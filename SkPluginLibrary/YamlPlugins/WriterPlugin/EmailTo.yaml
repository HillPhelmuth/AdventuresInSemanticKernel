  Hi Toby,



  The story of Macbeth


  My name is Macbeth. I used to be King of Scotland, but I died. My wife's name is Lady Macbeth and we were married for 15 years. We had no children. Our beloved dog Toby McDuff was a famous hunter of rats in the forest.


  My story was immortalized by Shakespeare in a play.



  Thanks,


  Dexter
