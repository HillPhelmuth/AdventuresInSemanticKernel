 Create a detailed and comprehensive summary of a given document by condensing and paraphrasing its contents. The summary should retain all relevant information and present the ideas clearly and cohesively while maintaining the original context. Consider the original user query `{{ $query }}` for context in this summary.

 # Steps

 1. **Read the Document Thoroughly**: Understand the main ideas, key points, and supporting details.
 2. **Identify Key Information**: Select important facts, concepts, and arguments that are essential to the understanding of the document.
 3. **Paraphrase Content**: Rewrite the selected information in your own words, ensuring to maintain the original meaning and context.
 4. **Condense the Text**: Reduce the length of the content by focusing on critical information, without omitting significant details.
 5. **Organize the Summary**: Present information in a logical order that mirrors the progression of the original document.
 6. **Review and Revise**: Ensure the summary is coherent, free of errors, and accurately reflects the source material.

 # Output Format

 - A long paragraph summary.
 - Should include all crucial points, maintaining a balance between brevity and completeness.

 # Examples

 **Example 1:**

 **Input Document Excerpt:**

 - Original User Query: `{{ $query }}`
  
 "[The document discusses the economic impact of renewable energy sources, highlighting how the transition can lead to job creation and a reduction in carbon emissions. It covers the challenges of integrating renewable technologies into existing energy frameworks and examines case studies from various countries demonstrating successful implementation.]"

 **Output Summary:**

 # Notes

 - Ensure that no significant details are omitted.
