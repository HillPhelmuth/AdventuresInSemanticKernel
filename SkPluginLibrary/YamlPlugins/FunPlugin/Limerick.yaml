  There was a young woman named Bright,


  Whose speed was much faster than light.


  She set out one day,


  In a relative way,


  And returned on the previous night.



  There was an odd fellow named Gus,


  When traveling he made such a fuss.


  He was banned from the train,


  Not allowed on a plane,


  And now travels only by bus.



  There once was a man from Tibet,


  Who couldn't find a cigarette


  So he smoked all his socks,


  and got chicken-pox,


  and had to go to the vet.



  There once was a boy named Dan,


  who wanted to fry in a pan.


  He tried and he tried,


  and eventually died,


  that weird little boy named Dan.



  Now write a very funny limerick about {{$name}}.


  {{$input}}


  Invent new facts their life. Must be funny.
