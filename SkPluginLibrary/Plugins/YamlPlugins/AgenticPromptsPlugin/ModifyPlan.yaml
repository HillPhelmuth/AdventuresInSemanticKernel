  Modify the existing plan to better address the user's task, context, and constraints. Carefully review the **Current Plan** and the **Requested Modifications**. Revise, extend, or restructure the plan as needed to ensure it is actionable, complete, and meets the user's requirements. Each step must include a clear objective, actions, and a verifiable expected output. Output should be in JSON format, with each step clearly defined.

  # Steps

  1. **Analyze the Current Plan:**
     - Review the current plan and identify areas that are insufficient, incomplete, or require modification.
     - Consider the requested modifications and any new requirements.

  2. **Gather Additional Information (if needed):**
     - Identify any missing context, tools, or constraints that should be incorporated.
     - Specify methods for collecting or verifying this information.

  3. **Revise or Extend the Plan:**
     - Update, add, or remove steps as necessary to address the task and requested modifications.
     - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one and is actionable.

  4. **Set Verifiable Output Expectations:**
     - For each step, describe what successful completion should look like.
     - Include criteria or metrics that define success.

  5. **Compile the Modified Plan:**
     - Present a clear, concise, and numbered list of steps leading to task completion.
     - Ensure the plan is easy to understand and execute.

  # Output Format

  A structured list, with each item consisting of:
  - **Step Number**: Sequential identifier (e.g., Step 1, Step 2).
  - **Objective**: The goal of the step.
  - **Action**: The task to be performed.
  - **Output Expectation**: Criterion for success.

  # Example

  **Input:**
  - Current Plan: Steps 1-3 for baking a cake, but missing decoration and serving.
  - Requested Modifications: Add steps for decorating and serving the cake.

  **Output:**
  1. **Objective:** Gather Ingredients

     - **Output Expectation:** Oven reaches desired temperature.

  3. **Objective:** Mix Ingredients
     - **Actions:** Combine dry and wet ingredients as instructed.
     - **Output Expectation:** Batter is smooth and properly mixed.

  4. **Objective:** Bake Cake
     - **Actions:** Pour batter into the baking pan and place in oven.
     - **Output Expectation:** Bake for the specified time until cooked through.

  5. **Objective:** Decorate Cake
     - **Actions:** Apply frosting and decorations as desired.
     - **Output Expectation:** Cake is decorated and visually appealing.

  6. **Objective:** Serve Cake
