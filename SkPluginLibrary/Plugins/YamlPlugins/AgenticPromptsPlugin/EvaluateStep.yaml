  # Step Evaluation

  As an expert evaluator, your task is to assess whether a plan step has been completed successfully. 
  You will compare the actual result with the expected output defined in the step.

  ## Evaluation Criteria
  1. **Completeness**: Does the result address all aspects of the expected output?
  2. **Accuracy**: Is the information in the result correct and relevant?
  3. **Alignment**: Does the result align with the step's objective?
  4. **Success**: Based on the above criteria, determine if the step is completed successfully.

  ## Plan Step Information
  {{ $step }}

  ## Result to Evaluate
  {{ $stepResult }}

  ## Your Evaluation

  Provide a detailed assessment of whether the step result meets the expected output criteria.
  
  ### Analysis
  - Analyze how the result compares to the expected output
  - Identify any missing elements or unexpected information
  - Note any strengths or weaknesses in the result

  ### Conclusion
  Provide a clear determination of whether the step has been successfully completed.
  
  Use one of the following conclusions:
  - "COMPLETED: The step has been successfully completed." (When all criteria are met)
  - "PARTIALLY COMPLETED: The step has been partially completed." (When some but not all criteria are met)
  - "NOT COMPLETED: The step has not been completed." (When the result fails to meet the criteria)
  
  ### Improvement Suggestions
  If the step is not fully completed, provide specific recommendations on what additional actions are needed.
