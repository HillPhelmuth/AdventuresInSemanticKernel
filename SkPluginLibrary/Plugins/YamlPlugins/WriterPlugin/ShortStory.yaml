  Story Synopsis. Be sure the the MAIN CHARACTER behaves in accordance with the MAIN CHARACTER ALIGNMENT. 

  If the MAIN CHARACTER ALIGNMENT is evil, make the story very dark with the character as antihero and remaining evil. 

  If MAIN CHARACTER ALIGNMENT is good, make the story heroic. 

  If MAIN CHARACTER ALIGNMENT is neutral. make the story harrowing. 

  DO NOT REPEAT SYNOPSIS IN THE STORY.

  DO NOT STATE THE MAIN CHARACTER ALIGNMENT VERBATIM IN THE STORY. For example if the alignment is chaotic-neutral, never say 'chaotic-neutral' or 'chaotic-neutral alignment'. Always use non-d&d terms to describe the alignment.
