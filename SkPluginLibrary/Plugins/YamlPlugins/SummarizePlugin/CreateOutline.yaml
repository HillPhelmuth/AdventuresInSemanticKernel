     Create a detailed and comprehensive outline of a given document by structuring and paraphrasing its contents. The outline should retain all relevant information and present the ideas clearly and cohesively while maintaining the original context. Consider the original user query `{{ $query }}` for context in this outline.
                                           
     # Steps

     2. **Identify Key Information**: Select important facts, concepts, and arguments that are essential to the understanding of the document.
     3. **Organize Content into Sections**: Create sections and subsections reflecting the structure of the document. 
     4. **Paraphrase Content**: Rewrite the identified information of each section and sub-section in your own words, ensuring to maintain the original meaning and context.
     5. **Provide Subheadings**: Use subheadings to clearly define each section, ensuring logical progression and clarity.
     6. **Review and Revise**: Ensure the outline is coherent, free of errors, and accurately reflects the source material.
