John: Hello, how are you?
Jane: I'm fine, thanks. How are you?
John: I'm doing well, writing some example code.
Jane: That's great! I'm writing some example code too.
John: What are you writing?
Jane: I'm writing a chatbot.
John: That's cool. I'm writing a chatbot too.
Jane: What language are you writing it in?
John: I'm writing it in C#.
Jane: I'm writing it in Python.
John: That's cool. I need to learn Python.
Jane: I need to learn C#.
John: Can I try out your chatbot?
Jane: Sure, here's the link.
John: Thanks!
Jane: You're welcome.
Jane: Look at this poem my chatbot wrote:
Jane: Roses are red
Jane: Violets are blue
Jane: I'm writing a chatbot
Jane: What about you?
John: That's cool. Let me see if mine will write a poem, too.
John: Here's a poem my chatbot wrote:
John: The singularity of the universe is a mystery.
John: The universe is a mystery.
John: The universe is a mystery.
John: The universe is a mystery.
John: Looks like I need to improve mine, oh well.
Jane: You might want to try using a different model.
Jane: I'm using the GPT-3 model.
John: I'm using the GPT-2 model. That makes sense.
John: Here is a new poem after updating the model.
John: The universe is a mystery.
John: The universe is a mystery.
John: The universe is a mystery.
John: Yikes, it's really stuck isn't it. Would you help me debug my code?
Jane: Sure, what's the problem?
John: I'm not sure. I think it's a bug in the code.
Jane: I'll take a look.
Jane: I think I found the problem.
Jane: It looks like you're not passing the right parameters to the model.
John: Thanks for the help!
Jane: I'm now writing a bot to summarize conversations. I want to make sure it works when the conversation is long.
John: So you need to keep talking with me to generate a long conversation?
Jane: Yes, that's right.
John: Ok, I'll keep talking. What should we talk about?
Jane: I don't know, what do you want to talk about?
John: I don't know, it's nice how CoPilot is doing most of the talking for us. But it definitely gets stuck sometimes.
Jane: I agree, it's nice that CoPilot is doing most of the talking for us.
Jane: But it definitely gets stuck sometimes.
John: Do you know how long it needs to be?
Jane: I think the max length is 1024 tokens. Which is approximately 1024*4= 4096 characters.
John: That's a lot of characters.
Jane: Yes, it is.
John: I'm not sure how much longer I can keep talking.
Jane: I think we're almost there. Let me check.
Jane: I have some bad news, we're only half way there.
John: Oh no, I'm not sure I can keep going. I'm getting tired.
Jane: I'm getting tired too.
John: Maybe there is a large piece of text we can use to generate a long conversation.
Jane: That's a good idea. Let me see if I can find one. Maybe Lorem Ipsum?
John: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Jane: I found a Lorem Ipsum generator.
Jane: Here's a 4096 character Lorem Ipsum text:
Jane: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, con
Jane: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, nunc sit amet aliquam
Jane: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, nunc sit amet aliquam
Jane: Darn, it's just repeating stuf now.
John: I think we're done.
Jane: We're not though! We need like 1500 more characters.
John: Oh Cananda, our home and native land.
Jane: True patriot love in all thy sons command.
John: With glowing hearts we see thee rise.
Jane: The True North strong and free.
John: From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
Jane: God keep our land glorious and free.
John: O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
Jane: O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
Jane: That was fun, thank you. Let me check now.
Jane: I think we need about 600 more characters.
John: Oh say can you see?
Jane: By the dawn's early light.
John: What so proudly we hailed.
Jane: At the twilight's last gleaming.
John: Whose broad stripes and bright stars.
Jane: Through the perilous fight.
John: O'er the ramparts we watched.
Jane: Were so gallantly streaming.
John: And the rockets' red glare.
Jane: The bombs bursting in air.
John: Gave proof through the night.
Jane: That our flag was still there.
John: Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave.
Jane: O'er the land of the free.
John: And the home of the brave.
Jane: Are you a Seattle Kraken Fan?
John: Yes, I am. I love going to the games.
Jane: I'm a Seattle Kraken Fan too. Who is your favorite player?
John: I like watching all the players, but I think my favorite is Matty Beniers.
Jane: Yeah, he's a great player. I like watching him too. I also like watching Jaden Schwartz.
John: Adam Larsson is another good one. The big cat!
Jane: WE MADE IT! It's long enough. Thank you!
John: You're welcome. I'm glad we could help. Goodbye!
Jane: Goodbye!
