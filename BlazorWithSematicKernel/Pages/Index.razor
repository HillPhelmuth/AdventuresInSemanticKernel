            Though it's open source with <em>many</em> great contributions from the community, Semantic Kernel is Microsoft's baby, born out of the desire to make AI services more accessible and easy to use for app developers. It offers a smart set of connectors that let you plug in memories and models to your app, giving it a virtual "brain" that can store and process information. But that's not all; it also gives you access to AI plugins, which act as the "body" of your AI app. These plugins are versatile, with prompts and native functions that can interact with the real world by responding to triggers and performing actions.
